UX Portfolio - http://robmakes.com/

My 9-6 gig is in the city, as one of InRhythm's UX Designers, placed into their client's offices for in-house, project-oriented user experience undertakings.

In the evenings and weekends I run my web marketing company Opuscule, helping small business clients optimize their online presence. From website design and development to SEO, branding and email marketing - I've done it all. In the portfolio there's a magician, a law firm, a personal trainer, an author and a therapist, to name a few.

From 2006 to 2013 I ran Opuscule full time, helping small businesses get online and be found; compiling the best solutions for their brand, budget, needs and timeline.
