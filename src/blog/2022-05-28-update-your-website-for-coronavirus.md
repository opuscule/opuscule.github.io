With millions of businesses across the United States closing because of the Coronavirus, adding a notification to your website is important to inform customers if you are open or not.

Most of Opusculeâ€™s restaurant clients are either closed completely, or only open for take out & delivery. For each, we worked quickly to update their websites with the critical information. In one case, we created a complete eCommerce solution where loyal customers could order online and have their orders loaded into their trunks on arrival.

For our law firm clients, posting notices about office closures were careful to include how the teams were working remotely and still taking calls. Understandably, with some of the local court houses closed, and others working on emergency orders, there is a lot of confusion.

### Can We Help?

Adding a notification bar to the top of your website takes just a few minutes, and Opuscule is happy to help for free. Let us know how we can help make updates to your online profiles too, like Google my Business and Yelp.
