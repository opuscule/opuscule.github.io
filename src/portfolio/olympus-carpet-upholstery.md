Owner, operator Timothy Sanoguet had worked with GoDaddy, using their Website Builder to create a site for his company. And for a while, that seemed enough to get him up and running.

With his amazing customer service and impressive, experienced work, Olympus Carpet & Upholstery quickly outgrew that starter website. In addition, it just wasn’t able to handle the aggressive SEO campaign he wanted to undertake. In comes Opuscule…

We worked with Timothy to generate a new logo & brand. Then, using a pre-made theme we were able to get a professional-looking website, optimized for search engines, live and indexed. Opuscule is happy to continue our relationship with Olympus Carpet & Upholstery, and be sure to check them out for amazing services in our area.
