Opuscule first helped Jones & Devoy, LLP launch their firm’s website in 2011, but after seven years it was feeling stale. Facing local competition and updates to Google’s algorithm, it was time for a refresh.

Using a pre-made theme, Opuscule was able to apply a fresh coat of paint without having to migrate any content. Imagine simply rearranging a few pieces of furniture to achieve a whole new look and feel on your website.

In addition, we added an SSL Certificate making the site secure and more appealing for Google’s search, plus optimized the images & minified and cached files. Oh, and all the images were replaced with more true-to-life stock photos, which didn’t cost the client any more.
