            <p>Even though we share the same city, Opuscule hasn't personally met the owners of Bengal Tiger Indian Food. The entire project was launched and published through phone calls and emails. The mobile-responsive WordPress website started with a template, but was converted into a one-page site with custom layouts. And although they have a login and password, the owner still calls and emails to help them add new items to the menu. We'll make it in for lunch one day.</p>
