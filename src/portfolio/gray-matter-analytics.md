When Gray Matter Analytics sent Opuscule an RFP, they said, “currently, our website appears dated and there is an abundance of irrelevant data.” We worked with them to understand their users and establish goals & KPIs. We reviewed their proprietary customer portal, using consistent design elements where possible. And turned custom design from [Jillian Nadell](http://www.jilliannadell.com/) into a fully customizable WordPress website giving their team complete control over content and images.

But we didn’t stop there! Opuscule was able to add various Custom Post Types to accommodate their press releases and case studies plus delivered a comprehensive style guide. We ensured their site would run on a secure, optimized server and incorporated SEO best practices throughout the site.
