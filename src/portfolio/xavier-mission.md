titleTag: WordPress Website for Non-Profit Organization | NYC Soup Kitchen
metaDescription: For an organization who, amongst other programs and projects,
  runs New York City’s largest Sunday soup kitchen – their website wasn’t a
  reflection the level of service they provide for many of our city’s most
  needy; until Opuscule stepped in. We worked closely with the Executive
  Director to add dozens of FAQs, events, pages and blog posts.

For an organization who, amongst other programs and projects, runs New York City’s largest Sunday soup kitchen – their website wasn’t a reflection the level of service they provide for many of our city’s most needy; until Opuscule stepped in. We worked closely with the Executive Director to add dozens of FAQs, events, pages and blog posts.

The task was to create a website which was able to communicate with guests, volunteers and donors. Including their branding and highlighting measurable results were a requirement, too. In the end, Opuscule delivered a fully editable, fast, secure WordPress website on our hosting platform.

Check out what Xavier Mission has to offer and we encourage you to become a volunteer or donor today!

> Robert is knowledgeable, helpful, and very patient, which was important given that my knowledge of web design is pretty much nil. He’s personable and friendly and very easy to work with. As a small non-profit, I was worried that we’d have to break our bank to get this project done well but his rates are extremely reasonable and we came in well under budget.
