In a collaboration with [Mitra Design Studio](https://mitradesignstudio.com/), we turned their designs and expert copywriting into an optimized, mobile friendly website using a static site generator, complete with a basic content management system. 

This site is minified, concatenated, and uses `.webp` images where available. We were responsible for scores of redirects, along with custom contact forms & validation.
