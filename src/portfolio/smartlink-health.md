[Jillian’s](https://opuscule.com/about/jillian-nadell/) design enhancements used font and color choices to drive users to clear CTAs, improving conversions site wide. [Robert’s](https://opuscule.com/about/robert-bowman-iii/) development updates helped make the site faster and more secure, plus gave the site’s admins more flexibility to update their pages in WordPress.
