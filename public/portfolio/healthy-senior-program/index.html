<p>In our first partnership of many with <a href="https://www.envisionmarketingpr.com/">Envision Health</a>, Opuscule was tasked with designing, developing and launching a brochure-style website for a pilot program by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to distribute fitness trackers.</p>
<p>Using the brand guidelines and steered by the print collateral, the design process, lead by Jillian, was able to skip wireframing and jump directly into visual design for an expedited timeline. As a pilot program, the need to be flexible and budget conscious was married to the need to meet standards for security and compliance.</p>
